## Overview

This an exercise from the Git and Github Bootcamp course I'm taking through Udemy. The course is instructed by Colt Steele. This is the closing exercise (lesson # 60) from Section 7: Adding and Committing.

### The challenge

This is over the basics of merging.
The exercise has 3 parts:

-Part 1: Fast Forward Merge

Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by creating one on your own.

Make a new branch. Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a fast forward merge.  Merge that branch into master.

-Part 2: Merge Commit (No Conflicts)

Your goal is to generate a merge commit with NO MERGE CONFLICTS.

Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a merge commit.  The merge should not result in any conflicts. Merge that branch into master. 

-Part 3: Conflicts

Your goal is to generate merge a conflict.

Create a new branch.  Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into the master branch, it results in a merge conflict. Merge that branch into master and resolve the conflict.

### What I learned

- Making and staging commits
- How to view commits using git log and git log --oneline

### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This is the final exercise from Section 7. There are exercises that I have done since this one which I will also add. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice.
